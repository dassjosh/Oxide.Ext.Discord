## About

**Oxide.Ext.Discord** is an Oxide extension which acts as a bridge between Oxide and the Discord API.

## Upgrading to version 3.0.0
Before upgrading to version 3.0.0, make sure all the discord extension plugins you plan to use support the new version. 
Plugins that were made for version 1.0.0 or 2.0.0 are **not** compatible with version 3.0.0.

1) Open the server files, and navigate to the "Managed" folder (e.g. "RustDedicated_Data/Managed")
2) Download the latest release.
3) Copy the "Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll" file into your "Managed" folder.
4) Restart your server!

## Commands
Console commands for the Discord Extension:  
`de.version` - displays the current Discord Extension version  
`de.websocket.reset` - resets all websockets to fix bugged connections  
`de.websocket.reconnect` - reconnect all websockets  
`de.rest.reset` - reset all rest API clients  
`de.search.highperformance.enable 1/0` - enable or disable high performance player name searches  
`de.placeholders.list` - list all available placeholders registered in the Discord Extension  
`de.pool.clearentities` - resets pool entities  
`de.pool.remove` - removes all pools currently registered  
`de.log.console ` - set's the console log level (Verbose, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Exception, Off)  
`de.log.file` - set's the file log level (Verbose, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Exception, Off)  
`de.validation.enable 1/0` - enable / disable api request validation  
`de.debug` - prints debug information for the Discord Extension  
`de.help` - displays the command help text  

## Discord Application Commands
Commands the Discord Extension registers on the bot:  
`/de commands delete` - deletes an application command from the bot. This should be used when a plugin registers a command but is no longed used.  

## Discord Templates
Discord Templates allow server owners to fully customize Discord messages and Slash Commands.
These messages / commands can be localized and follow a similar pattern to Oxide lang.
To get started the plugin must support the new Discord Templates functionality added in Discord Extension 3.0
If a plugin supports templates you can find the editable templates in the following directory `oxide/discord/{PluginName}/`.
Inside the plugin folder, you will find a folder for each type of template a plugin has registered.
The most common ones you will see are `message` and `command`.
Inside the message folder, you will find global templates. 
Global templates are messages that aren't sent to a user but globally to a Discord server.
You might also see a folder `en` this is the folder for english message templates.
By default, the fallback language for all messages will be english that matches Oxide's functionality.
If you wanted to localize a message in German, you would make a copy of the `en` folder and name it `de`.
Then inside the `de` folder you would update the messages to be in german.
After making all the changes in the `de` folder you can reload the plugin for the changes to take effect.

## Discord Placeholders
Discord Placeholders allows for greater message customization for server owners and plugin developers.
This feature is a big part of Discord Templates but can really be used anywhere a plugin developer would want it to.
Placeholders follow the same format used in PlaceholdersAPI and can use PlaceholdersAPI for placeholders as well.
You can get the list of available placeholders by typing `de.placeholders.list`.
This will list out all the available placeholders to use.
Placeholders have the following format `{name:format}`.
The `name` is the name of the placeholder.
`format` is the format to apply to the placeholder.
`format` is optional and the majority of the time will not be used.  
**NOTE:** Which placeholders can be used depends on the context. 
You won't be able to use an IPlayer placeholder if there is no IPlayer available to use for the given context.
