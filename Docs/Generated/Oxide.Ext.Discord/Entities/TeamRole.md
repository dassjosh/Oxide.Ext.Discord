Represents [Team Role Types](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/teams#team-member-roles-team-member-role-types)

```csharp
public enum TeamRole : byte
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner | `Owner` | Owners are the most permissible role, and can take destructive, irreversible actions like deleting team-owned apps or the team itself. Teams are limited to 1 owner. |
| Admin | `Admin` | Admins have similar access as owners, except they cannot take destructive actions on the team or team-owned apps. |
| Developer | `Developer` | Developers can access information about team-owned apps, like the client secret or public key. They can also take limited actions on team-owned apps, like configuring interaction endpoints or resetting the bot token. Members with the Developer role cannot manage the team or its members, or take destructive actions on team-owned apps. |
| ReadOnly | `ReadOnly` | Read-only members can access information about a team and any team-owned apps. Some examples include getting the IDs of applications and exporting payout records. |
